I hate nested objects. So I did a bunch of exercise creating them. This one creates objects that are nested dynamically under inputted key strings.

I realised the structure of the nested object is similar to that of a linked list. So I added couple of functionality of deleting a key(element) or inserting a key at a given point.

I also made a similar program that creates a binary tree in the form of nested objects. I hate it. Traversing through it is a real  bastard.
